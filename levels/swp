There must be a way.



I have concocted a potion through which whose consumption I have seen the horrific depths of human imagination. Within these depths lies the answer of eternal life. Yet the effects of the potion have left me in a daze. Surely, I am doomed to madness. Inexplicable volition drives me deeper into these horrors.



Here it is. I have unearthed the sacred elixir. This potion of hyper-real planes of existence. I and I alone have created this with my own hands. I am the hand of God. I am in control of the universe.

The moment of truth. I inbibe in my eternal prize.
